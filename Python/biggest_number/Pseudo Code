Problem:

    Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to input N and N numbers. Suppose that the
    numbers are in the range -5000 <= x <= 5000. This algorithm/flowchart should find and
    output the largest of N numbers.


def function():

    array = [Random 100 numbers between -5000 and 5000]

    iCounter = 1 (To control the loop)

    iMax = array[0] (symbolic biggest number)

    while iCounter != 100:

        if ( array[iCounter] > iMax):

            iMax = array[iCounter]

        else

            iCounter++
