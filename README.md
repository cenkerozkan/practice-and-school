# CMPE226 Data Structures with C++
## About
- In this folder, I will share my work and the codes I wrote in order to be practical for the data structures course.

- Compilers and standards are:
  - **Microsoft MSVC C++14**
  - TDM-GCC Mingw-64 C++11

- Every folder will have it's own UML structure in order to make the code more understandable.
