# practice-and-school
## About
- It is a simple repository that includes the problems I have solved so far in order to fit the programming logic well, and I am going to continue to update it as I solve more.
- I will also use this repository to store same problems with other programming languages' syntaxes.
- Each program is responsible for performing the specific tasks assigned such as:
  - Average grade calculation for students.
  - Some simple matrix operations like matrix multiplication.
- From now on, I will start to upload different files related to courser other than just programming courses.
  
  etc.
