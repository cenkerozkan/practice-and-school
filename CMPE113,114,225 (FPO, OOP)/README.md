# practice-and-school
## About
- It is a simple repository that includes the problems I have solved so far in order to fit the programming logic well, and I am going to continue to update it as I solve more.
- I will also use this repository to store same problems with other programming languages' syntaxes.
- Each program is responsible for performing the specific tasks assigned such as:
  - Average grade calculation for students.
  - Some simple matrix operations like matrix multiplication.
  
  etc.

## Notes
- Programs which written in C were compiled under: 
   - **MinGW GCC 9.2.0 32-bit**, for this reason header files may differ for different platforms (Linux, MacOS etc.).
   - **GCC 8.2.0 64-bit**, on Ubuntu 20.04 WSL2
   - **GCC 11.2.0 64-bit** on Manjaro Linux
